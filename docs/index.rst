pyshqg
======

``pyshqg`` is a python solver for the `Marshal and Molteni (1993) quasi-geostrophic (QG) model <https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1993)050%3C1792:TADUOP%3E2.0.CO;2>`_.
QG models express the conservation of potential vorticity over time and are
meant to describe the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere under specific hypotheses.
This QG model is very special, because it is expressed in spherical harmonics and
because it encapsulates complex physical processes.
